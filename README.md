# LiveScoreboard

A coding exercise for the Junior Software Engineer position at Sportradar.

**IDE:** Visual Studio 2022  
**Language:** C++  
**Testing tools:** Microsoft Unit Testing Framework for C++  

## Notes
- GetSummary() is non-transformative. It doesn't modify the scoreboard vector.
- Matches get updated and removed by their index in the scoreboard vector, **NOT** the vector from GetSummary().
